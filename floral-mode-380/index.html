<h5> My Travel Articles </h5>

<h6> My trip to the United States Of America </h6>

<h7> I like to travel a lot. I have been to many places but my favourite trip was to the United States Of America.we went there to visit my father's brother. our flight was around 11:00pm. This was an exciting experience for me as I had never been on a flight more than 2 hours. On the flight from Dubai to the USA before you could blink your eyes, I was asleep. more than half of the flight, i was asleep. i was awake only for breakfast,lunch and dinner.when i finally reached, i thought we were on that flight for an year. When we got out of the airport,it was so cold that even after wearing our fleece jackets, we were feeling very cold. My uncle(my father's brother)came to pick us up.when i saw his house, I was flabbergasted! The home had its own swimming pool! The thing that impressed me was that they had one of my favourite cars,the FORD MUSTANG.these cars were not very common in India. These cost around 75 to 80 lakhs.when we reached there, the next day I slept in the afternoon and woke up the evening the next day. I slept for around 18 to 20 hours. all this happened due to jet lag. We went to L.A and visited Disneyland,Seaworld in San Diego and many other places.

<h8> <br>A visit to Goa </h8>

<h9> <br> My second favourite place that we visited was Goa. It is the smallest state in India. we went there on my birthday. Once we landed at the Goa airport, after taking all the luggage, I just realized that we had one less luggage. I told my father about it but he thought we had all the luggage. Once we got into the cab, the airport authorities called that our suitcase had been kept as no one had come to claim it. After that, always when we went out on trips, my father would keep me in charge of the suitcases. That day we went to the beach and played a lot. The next day(4th march,my birthday) my parents took me to fort aguada taj hotel. It was a surprise for my birthday!the hotel was very nice and the room was the best. It was like a little bungalow. The hotel was near a beach. i went there with my grandparents. It is rare that my grandparents don't come to goa. it's been only once that they did not come to goa. all the other times we were together in goa. This was my second best trip.
